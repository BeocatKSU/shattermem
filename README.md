Fragments memory for testing


Yes, you read that correctly. We had a problem that we suspected was due to fragmented memory. There are lots of articles
around the web on how to defragment memory, but nothing on how to cause fragmented memory. This program allocates as much
memory as you want, then drops half of it, such that the remaining memory is fragmented. After one hour, the originally
allocated memory is also released.
